/* Abed is Troy's best friend. He likes
   being independent, so he will move
   diagonally to the bottom left.
   
   When Abed has little Abed's, he wants
   them to be born above him, so they
   will be placed towards the north.
   
   Abed would never fight Troy, but if
   he were to meet another Critter besides
   Troy, he will get into a heated debate
   with them about the media and fight them.
