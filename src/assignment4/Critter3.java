/* This Critter is named Troy. Troy likes to 
   live an uncomplicated life, so he only
   moves eastward.
   
   Troy only makes little Troy's when he has at
   least 100 energy.
   
   Troy is Abed's best friend and would never
   fight Abed. However, since he is very
   protective of his friend Abed, he will fight
   anyone else that runs into him just so Abed
   would be safe.
